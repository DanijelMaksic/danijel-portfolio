# Blog App

### A simple blogging app with a bookmark feature. Built with vanilla JavaScript using MVC architecture.

<HeroImage image={BlogImg} title="Blog App" />

My Blog is a vanilla JavaScript app which enables the user to write articles. It is built in HTML, with vanilla CSS and JavaScript. App is structured in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture model, which splits the application into three parts for easier understanding and less spaghetti code.

<br />

<TableOfContents
   h2Arr={[
      'initial-screen',
      'creating-an-article',
      'managing-bookmarked-articles',
   ]}
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'initial-screen'} text={'Initial screen'} />

If there are no articles yet, user will be greeted with this message. Articles can be filtered by tags and saved to the bookmarks.

<br />

<ArticleImage image={BlogImg1} alt="Initial screen" />

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'creating-an-article'} text={'Crating an article'} />

When add article button is clicked, a modal will pop out. In this modal window user can write the article, along with deciding on a tag.

<br />

After publishing the article, modal will close and article will be displayed now. If user is not happy with the result, article can be edited or deleted.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={BlogImg3}
   alt="Initial screen with newlt published article"
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2
   id={'managing-bookmarked-articles'}
   text={'Managing bookmarked articles'}
/>

Articles can be saved to the bookmarks, which can be found on the top-left part of the page.
