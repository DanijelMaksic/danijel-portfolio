In the details page of the specific order, all the information about said order will be displayed in easy-to-read manner. On this page user can choose to archive (confirm and complete) the order. Archiving the order will update the inventory and the dashboard stats.

Archive is the other part of the order management system, where user can browse past orders if there is need for it. Dashboard uses these orders to display the statistics about individual and total sales.

<br />

This is the archived order page, which lists the details of specific past order. Deleting the archived order will update the statistics in dashboard.
