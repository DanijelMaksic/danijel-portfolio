# Ochrid Gallery CMS

### A Content Management System (CMS) app for a fictional gallery. Limited only to employees, it includes inventory and order management.

<HeroImage image={OchridGalleryCMSImg} title="Ochrid Gallery CMS" />

This is the internal application of the public webstore "Ochrid Gallery". This is the closed-off app that only selected employees of the business have access to. It is an SPA powered by **React**, providing user with fast navigation.

<br />

The app's data is stored in the **Supabase** database, which also handles user authentication and authorization. Deployed on **Vercel**.

      'login-screen',
      'dashboard',
      'inventory-management',

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'login-screen'} text={'Login Screen'} />

Firstly, only approved users can log in. Existing users are the only ones who can create new user accounts. When a new user wants to gain access to the website, they use a password provided by an existing user and, after they verify their e-mail address, they can log in.

<br />

After logging in, user will see the dashboard page, which contains all the relevant
information and statistics about the business. Here user can also access the incoming
orders in the Today section.

<ArticleH2 id={'inventory-management'} text={'Inventory management'} />

The first major part of the application is the inventory management. On this page user can add a new icon to the inventory.

<br />

<br />
<br />

On the Icons page we can find the main part of the inventory system, where icons can be browsed, edited or deleted. Any changes here will affect what the public e-commerce website displays.

<br />

<ArticleImage image={CmsImg3} alt="Icons page" />

<br />
<br />

Each icon has its own page with some relevant information about it.

<br />

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'order-management'} text={'Order management'} />

Here comes the second major part of the app, the order management. Any incoming orders will be displayed here. Every order has its own Order ID, which can be used to keep track of it.

<br />

<ArticleImage image={CmsImg5} alt="Orders page" />

<br />
<br />

In the details page of the specific order, all the information about said order will be displayed in an easy-to-read manner. On this page user can choose to archive (confirm and complete) the order. Archiving the order will update the inventory and the dashboard stats.

<br />

<br />
<br />

Archive is the other part of the order management system, where users can browse past orders if there is a need for it. Dashboard uses these orders to display the statistics about individual and total sales.

<br />

<ArticleImage image={CmsImg7} alt="Archive" />

<br />
<br />

This is the archived order page, which lists the details of a specific past order. Deleting the archived order will update the statistics in the dashboard.

<br />

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'user-settings'} text={'User settings'} />

In the end we have the "Users" page, where new users can be added or existing ones updated.

<br />

<br />
<br />

The final page is the update account page, where user can edit account information or password.
