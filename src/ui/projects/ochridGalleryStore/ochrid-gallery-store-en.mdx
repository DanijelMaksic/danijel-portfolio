# Ochrid Gallery E-commerce

### A Next.js e-commerce website for a fictional gallery. Features checkout functionality and user authentication.

<HeroImage image={OchridGalleryStoreImg} title="Ochrid Gallery E-commerce" />

Ochrid Gallery is a web store that enables its users to browse and order icons. The website is powered by **Next.js**, which provides fast initial load time and server-side rendering. It is styled with **Tailwind** and can be used on a variety of devices thanks to the responsive design. The app's data is stored in the **Supabase** database. Deployed on **Vercel**.

<br />

<TableOfContents
   h2Arr={[
      'landing-page',
      'icons-page',
      'icon-details',
      'checkout-process',
      'account-section',
      'credits',
   ]}
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'landing-page'} text={'Landing page'} />

Upon entering the website, user will first see the gallery's landing page. Some general information about the business is outlined here.

<br />

<ArticleImage

   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg0}
   alt="Landing page"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'icons-page'} text={'Icons page'} />

On the icons page, users can browse various icons, which can be sorted and filtered based on user's preferences.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg1}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg1}
   alt="Icons page"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'icon-details'} text={'Icon details'} />

Each icon has its own page with some more details and features, where user can add an icon to cart, wishlist and review it.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg2}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg2}
   alt="Icon details"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'checkout-process'} text={'Checkout process'} />

After one or more icons have been added to cart, user can visit the "Shopping cart" page. This page contains cart management, a summary of the order and some featured popular products. Here user can start the checkout process, but in order to proceed to the next part, user needs to register/log in using their **Google** profile.

<br />

<ArticleImage

   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg3}
   alt="Shopping cart"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

After logging in, user can continue to the "Billing information" page. Here user can choose an address from their address book or use some other address. Input validation is handled by **Zod** library.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg4}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg4}
   alt="Billing information"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

Next is the "Payment method" page, where one of two methods can be chosen. Here, user can also leave an optional note if something about the order needs to be clarified.

<br />

<ArticleImage

   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg5}
   alt="Payment method"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

For the final part of the checkout, we have the "Review order" page, where user can review all the details about the order. After making sure everything is correct, user can place the order, which will be sent to the store's Content Management System (CMS) app for an employee to confirm it.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg6}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg6}
   alt="Review order"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'account-section'} text={'Account section'} />

After registering/logging in, user can access the account management part of the website. By default, user will be greeted by the "Profile overview" page, which includes certain account activity statistics.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg7}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg7}
   alt="Account page"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

Next up is the "Order history" page, where past (completed) orders can be inspected.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg8}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg8}
   alt="Order history"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

Continuing, we come across the "Wishlist" page, where user's saved icons can be accessed.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg9}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg9}
   alt="Wishlist"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

The following page showcases user's reviews. In order to review an icon, user first needs to be logged in and then buy it (more precisely, reviewing will be unlocked upon order confirmation and completion).

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg10}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg10}
   alt="Reviews"
   isResponsive={true}
/>

<br />
<br />

Finally, we come to the "Address book" page, where user can save their addresses and choose their favorite one.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={StoreImg11}
   imageMobile={StoreMobileImg11}
   alt="Address book"
   isResponsive={true}
/>
